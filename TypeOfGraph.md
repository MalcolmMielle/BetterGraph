# Type of Graph supported

## Pseudo Graph

A pseudograph is a non-simple graph in which both graph loops and multiple edges are permitted (Zwillinger 2003, p. 220).

## Simple Graph

A simple graph, also called a strict graph (Tutte 1998, p. 2), is an unweighted, undirected graph containing no graph loops or multiple edges (Gibbons 1985, p. 2; West 2000, p. 2; Bronshtein and Semendyayev 2004, p. 346). A simple graph may be either connected or disconnected.

Unless stated otherwise, the unqualified term "graph" usually refers to a simple graph. A simple graph with multiple edges is sometimes called a multigraph (Skiena 1990, p. 89).
